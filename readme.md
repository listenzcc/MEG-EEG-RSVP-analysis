# Analysis RSVP with MEG and EEG

## Load Data

The raw files after ICA artificial removal are named like
[data/RSVP_dataset/processed_data/{MODE}-{SUBJ}/block_{block}_ica-raw.fif](.)

The data is RSVP data,
the events are

- '1'/1: the onset of target images.
- '2'/2: the onset of non-target images.
- '3'/3: the trigger of key pressing.
